# Overview

This is a singleplayer Battleship game where the user is guessing coordinates to "shoot" with the objective being to sink all enemy ships in as few turns as possible. I created this program in Java for the purpose of learning Java and becoming familiar with it.

# Future Work

- Instead of the program ending when all ships have been sunk, have the program continue and give a "Play Again" option to the player.
- Implement a highscore feature, where the highest score achieved is remembered and displayed.
- Implement sound effects for misses, hits, and sinking ships.
